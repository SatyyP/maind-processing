      The Lough Ree Power Station is a large peat-fired power station in Lanesborough, in the Republic of Ireland. The station generates up 100 MWe of power, ranking as the Third largest peat-fired power station in the country, after West Offaly Power Station at 150 MWe.[1][2][3] and Edenderry Power Station at 120 MWe. The power station was constructed as a replacement to the ageing 85 MWe Lanesborough power station.
